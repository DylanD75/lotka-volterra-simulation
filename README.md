# Lotka Volterra Simulation
The Lotka Volterra Simulation is a Unity project that models the relationship between predator and prey through a visual simulation. This was the final project for my AP Calculus AB class. The predators are represented as red lynx roaming in a square environment, and the prey are blue hares. As the poplutions of both species fluctuate, it can be visually seen in the environment, providing context to how the population dynamics actually work between the species.

## Simulation
Here is a look into the simulation:
